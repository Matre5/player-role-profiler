\# Football Role Analysis Framework



\*\*A systematic approach to measuring player role compatibility using function-based metrics\*\*





Most player analysis focuses on \*\*output\*\* (goals, assists, ratings). This framework focuses on \*\*function\*\* (how players are deployed, what they're asked to do).



By measuring role rather than results, we can:



\- Compare players across different team contexts

\- Identify transfer targets with compatible playing styles

\- Predict tactical fit before signing

\- Remove reputation bias from scouting
