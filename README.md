# Football Role Analysis Framework

Football recruitment often focuses on output.
This project focuses on function.

player-role-profiler is a role-based player analysis system that compares how players are used on the pitch using event data and machine learning.
The goal is not to rank players, but to evaluate **fit, redundancy, and tactical alignment.**

By measuring role rather than results, we can:
- Compare players across different team contexts
- Identify transfer targets with compatible playing styles
- Predict tactical fit before signing
- Remove reputation bias from scouting

## Future Applications

With this schema, you can:
- **Transfer market analysis:** Find undervalued players with compatible roles
- **Manager tactical fingerprinting:** Cluster managers by how they deploy similar player types
- **Academy talent projection:** Compare youth profiles to first-team role needs
- **Squad redundancy detection:** Identify overlapping role profiles in the same squad
