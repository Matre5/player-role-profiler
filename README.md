# Football Role Analysis Framework
A systematic approach to measuring player role compatibility using function-based metrics\*\*


Most player analysis focuses on <b>output</b> (goals, assists, ratings). This framework focuses on <b>function</b> (how players are deployed, what they're asked to do).
By measuring role rather than results, we can:
- Compare players across different team contexts
- Identify transfer targets with compatible playing styles
- Predict tactical fit before signing
- Remove reputation bias from scouting

## Future Applications

With this schema, you can:
- **Transfer market analysis:** Find undervalued players with compatible roles
- **Manager tactical fingerprinting:** Cluster managers by how they deploy similar player types
- **Academy talent projection:** Compare youth profiles to first-team role needs
- **Squad redundancy detection:** Identify overlapping role profiles in the same squad
